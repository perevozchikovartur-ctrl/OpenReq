# OpenReq

A modern, open-source API client for testing, debugging, and documenting HTTP APIs.

Homepage: https://openreq.app

---

**What You Get**
- Request builder, auth, scripting, environments, code generation, and visual test flows
- Import from Postman/OpenAPI/cURL, export to Postman
- WebSocket + GraphQL support
- AI-assisted collection import
- Desktop apps: Client and Standalone

---

**Product Options**
- **Standalone Desktop**: All-in-one installer (frontend + backend). No server required. Local SQLite.
- **Desktop Client**: Connects to your self-hosted backend for team workspaces.
- **Self-Hosted Web**: Run backend + web UI on your server.

---

**Quick Start (Docker)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/n1kozor/OpenReq.git
cd OpenReq
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

Open the app at `http://localhost:8000` and the API at `http://localhost:8000/api`.

---

**Manual Setup**

Backend:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend (new terminal):
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

---

**Desktop Builds (Windows)**
There are two Electron builds:
- Client build: connects to an external server.
- Standalone build: bundles the backend and runs offline with local SQLite.

Run from `desktop-app/`:
```bash
npm run build:client
npm run build:standalone
```

Standalone build steps:
- Builds the frontend with `VITE_STANDALONE=true`
- Copies `frontend/dist` into `backend/static`
- Builds a backend executable via PyInstaller
- Bundles backend into the Electron app resources
- Creates an NSIS installer

Standalone runtime defaults:
- Backend: `127.0.0.1:4010`
- Data: local SQLite under app user data
- Auth/setup: disabled

---

**Configuration**
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | `super-secret-change-me-in-production` | Secret key for JWT tokens |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./data/openreq.db` | Database connection string |
| `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` | `true` | Enable/disable user registration |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5173` | Allowed CORS origins |

### Keycloak / OpenID Connect

Set `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` to the Keycloak realm URL and `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` to an
OIDC client configured for authorization-code flow. Register
`OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` (or the application's `/api/v1/auth/oidc/callback`) as a
valid Keycloak redirect URI. Set `OIDC_FRONTEND_URL` when the frontend is on a
different origin.

If Keycloak uses a certificate issued by an internal CA, keep TLS verification
enabled and provide that CA as a PEM bundle. Mount it into the container and
set `OIDC_CA_BUNDLE` to its **container** path, for example:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env \
  -v "$PWD/keycloak-ca.pem:/etc/openreq/keycloak-ca.pem:ro" \
  -e OIDC_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/openreq/keycloak-ca.pem \
  openreq:oidc-test
```

Keycloak **client roles** are mapped at each login with JSON environment
variables. Roles are read from `resource_access.<OIDC_ROLE_CLIENT_ID>.roles`;
when `OIDC_ROLE_CLIENT_ID` is unset it uses `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`. Example:

```env
OIDC_INSTANCE_ROLE_MAP={"openreq-admin":"admin"}
```

`admin` controls instance-wide user and AI-settings administration.
Set `LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=false` to disable password-based sign-in and
registration after OIDC has been verified.

On a user's first OIDC sign-in, a verified OIDC email that matches an existing
local account attaches the external identity to that account automatically.
Its user ID, workspaces, and existing data are retained; after linking, its
password is no longer accepted by OpenReq. On subsequent OIDC sign-ins,
`preferred_username` and the full name are updated when the username is not
already used by another OpenReq account.

For access to multiple workspaces, use Keycloak's **Group Membership** mapper
on the OpenReq client and add the `groups` claim to the access token. OpenReq
recognizes these full group paths:

```text
/openreq/workspaces/<workspace-access-key>/admin
/openreq/workspaces/<workspace-access-key>/editor
/openreq/workspaces/<workspace-access-key>/viewer
```

Each workspace has a unique `access_key` visible in OpenReq's workspace dialog.
Unknown keys are ignored; groups never create workspaces automatically. OIDC
memberships are synchronized on login, while manually assigned memberships are
left untouched.
